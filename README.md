Ariel Atom RC
=============

A 1:7.5 scale model of the inimitable Ariel Atom, that's also remote controlled. 

I'm not gonna lie, though, this is my first crack at this. Not just the almost-entirely-from-scratch models and how they all go together, but also my first foray into the high-performance R/C arena.

I'm aiming to be as accurate as possible with the physical appearance of the thing, which includes the frame, body panels, and rims.
The finer points (steering, suspension) are currently loosely based upon what R/C assembly instructions I can find, since things like material strengths don't scale down linearly.
This is also because R/C part suppliers absolutely suck at actually providing the dimensions of their parts, and merely state what model it's intended for. Which is okay for them, but a big hassle for me. So I'm using a lot of McMaster-Carr's downloadable CAD models to make sure things can be assembled (any files prefixed by "McM").

Everything's in Solidworks 2012 because that's what I've been using. STLs will likely go up once I've got a 3D printer to do testing.


It's currently being designed for a BLDC-based drivetrain with a two-speed servo-shifted transmission, and there's plans for all kinds of fancy electronics (ie lights and data logging) in the works, but those are kind of dependent on how the rest of the system goes together.


**Current progress:**

The most developed portion of this is currently the front suspension:

This is the current (more or less) state of affairs of the entire rig, pre-front-suspension:
